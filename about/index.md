This is my personal GitHub site where I'm planning to post a whole bunch of different things. Most of the projects I post will include coding or analysis of some sort, but perhaps not everything.

This site was built using jekyll and the [Casper theme](https://jekyller.github.io/jasper2/) from Ghost.
