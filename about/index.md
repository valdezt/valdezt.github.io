This is my personal GitHub site where I'm planning to post a whole bunch of different things. Most of the projects I post will include coding or analysis of some sort, but perhaps not everything. I'll use this post to share a little about myself.

I grew up in the southwestern part of Ontario, Canada in the relatively small city of Windsor. When I was young, I loved watching baseball and hockey, and despite being a Canadian I cheered for Detroit sports teams. I played hockey as a kid (just doing my civic duty as a Canadian) and enjoyed watching the Red Wings win the cup a handful of times in the late 90s and early 2000s. I was lucky enough to see the greats like Yzerman, Shanahan, Lidstrom and Osgoode in person. I miss when the Wings were good...

As a teenager I developed an interest in music and started playing guitar with friends, drawing pathetically small crowds to local pubs playing both original and cover songs. For a time, I was convinced I wanted to study sound engineering and become a professional sound engineer. Needless to say, I grew out of that phase but the love for music persisted. Most often, you'll catch me listening to:

- [Jimmy Eat World](https://www.jimmyeatworld.com/)
- [John Mayer](https://www.johnmayer.com/)
- [City and Colour](https://www.cityandcolour.com/)
- [blink-182](https://www.blink182.com/)
- [Oasis](http://www.oasisinet.com/)
- [All Time Low](https://www.thebeatles.com/)
- [The Beatles](https://www.thebeatles.com/)
- [Kendrick Lamar](http://www.kendricklamar.com/)
- [Childish Gambino](http://www.childishgambino.com/)
- [Mac Miller (RIP)](http://www.macmillerswebsite.com/)

and many others.

This is me at about 19 thinking I was super fly. Spoiler alert: I was not.

At the same time, I started to read a lot of fiction. If I'm honest, I picked up reading a bit more heavily when I watched the TV show Lost. Yeah you know, the one where they crash on the island and see a polar bear? There were a lot of literary references to classic and popular fiction that I didn't understand and so I started buying relevant books and reading them. I fell in love with Charles Dickens, Stephen King, and J.R.R. Tolkein to name a few. Some of my favourites (off the top of my head) are:

- [*The Dark Tower* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)) by Stephen King
- [*A Song of Ice and Fire* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) by George R. R. Martin
- [*A Tale of Two Cities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities) by Charles Dickens
- [*Y: The Last Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man) by Brian K. Vaughan
- [*A Prayer for Owen Meany*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany) by John Irving
- [*Flowers for Algernon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon) by Daniel Keyes

and a whole bunch more that I'm sure I'm forgetting. I'm currently halfway through George R. R. Martin's *A Storm of Swords* for the second time while also reading Robert Kirkman's graphic novel series [*Invincible*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invincible_(comics)) for the first time. I highly recommend both.

Toward the end of high school when I had to choose more of my courses, I fell in love with physics, mathematics and the cosmos. Though I was never top of my class in high school, I exceled at these subject just because I found them so interesting. I guess I enjoyed the thought that we could describe everything happening with elegant mathematic equations.

My dude Bert Onestone. But actually though this is [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) in case you're not familiar.

I received my undergraduate degree in physics with minors in mathematics and computer science from the University of Windsor. It was a small program, but that meant everybody knew everybody. The professors knew just about every student beyond first year and every student knew every other student in their year. I met a lot of people that I still consider good friends, as well as the woman who would later become my wife. Melissa and I met in our first year physics lab, and started going out in our second year of school. She's smart and strong and one of the nicest and sweetest people I've ever met. I owe her a lot. As a woman studying science (especially physics and computer science), she was in the minority population of the class and she has a lot of interesting stories to tell. If you want to read some of them, you can check out [her blog](https://melissamathers.ca/).

Yes, we dressed up for Halloween at 21 as Bill Nye and a box of Nerds candy.

While in undergrad, my love of the cosmos weaned a bit when I discovered the world of the infinitely small in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics). I got a few scholarships to perform undergraduate research and wrote my thesis under [Dr. Gordon Drake](http://drake.sharcnet.ca/mediawiki/index.php/Dr._Gordon_Drake%27s_Research_Group) on the helium atom and the theoretical nuclear charge at which the atom would lose one electron (more on that in a later post). While this kind of research may seem out there, it has applications to the stability of [three-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) systems (e.g. a star with two planets in orbit) which is an as-yet unsolved problem in classical physics. While in this lab I learned how to code and more importantly I learned about the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). This would later become the holy grail of languages for me ([Monty Python](http://montypython.com/) reference intended).

Around the same time I started watching a lot of baseball, and playing some beer league ball once a week. Call me a bandwagon jumper if you like, but I got heavily into baseball in 2011 when the Tigers boasted big arms like Justin Verlander *and* Max Scherzer, and big bats like Victor Martinez, Magglio Ordonez, and Miguel Cabrera in his prime. I got partial season tickets a few years in undergrad and I still absolutely love baseball. Some traditional baseball fans might say that nerds like me are [ruining the game](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2791455-i-find-it-very-difficult-to-watch-why-mlb-greats-think-baseballs-in-trouble) with numbers, but I'm excited for what the future of baseball analytics holds.

I loved physics enough to want to continue research in grad school, which is when I moved to Toronto to work under [Eric Hessels at York University](https://www.physics.yorku.ca/faculty-profiles/hessels-eric/). I initially enrolled to work toward my M.Sc. but switched to the Ph.D. stream after a little less than a year. The project to which I was assigned was a [precise measurement of the proton radius using atomic hydrogen](https://news.yorku.ca/2019/09/05/scientists-measure-precise-proton-radius-to-help-resolve-decade-old-puzzle/). To put it a bit more simply, we measured properties of hydrogen and used some equations to translate this into a measurement of the proton radius. This work was motivated by recent precision measurements using muonic hydrogen that disagreed with the accepted size of the proton by as many as seven standard deviations. This was essentially a discrepancy that was impossible to refute that became known as the [proton radius puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_radius_puzzle).

Einstein being sassy.

Over the course of three years I learned a lot in this experimental lab, including principles of experiment design (both physical and mathematical), how to work with vacuum systems, how to use RF equipment, and how to design and machine parts for the apparatus. Most importantly though, I learned I didn't want to continue researching physics for the rest of my life. As much as I enjoyed my project and the people I worked with, I just couldn't see myself doing that for the rest of my life. So after three years and [one fantastic publication](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/1007.abstract) I made the decision to leave York with a M.Sc. and try to find work as a data scientist.

Why [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)? Well, I think I wanted to become a data scientist because it takes a lot of the things I enjoyed about solving problems as a physicist and applies them to industry problems in an interesting way. I love coding, math/stats and problem solving. What better job could I ask for?

A meme because that is who I am.

After a few months of searching and writing up my thesis, I found a job at a fintech in downtown Toronto, and moved right downtown with my wife. After so many years of studying around the clock, I finally have some time to work on passion projects and this personal page is where I plan to post them, among other things. The purpose of this post is to give some context on who I am, what interests I have and why a lot of my posts involve baseball, physics, music, etc.

Please don't hesitate to [contact me](https://valdezt.github.io/contact) if you have some thoughts or questions about my posts, data science, and anything else on this blog.
