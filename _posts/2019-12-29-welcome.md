Hi, I'm Travis and this is my personal Github page.

I've been looking to start a blog/website of my own for quite some time and had a few failed starts because I didn't like the format or wasn't proud of the content, etc. This is my latest attempt and hopefully this one sticks. I don't plan to post often, but I'd like to start posting some of my data projects in both working and final states. I don't have anything "finished" at the moment but I'd like to post a WIP sometime soon.

If you'd like to know more about me, check out the [About](https://valdezt.github.io/about) page.
